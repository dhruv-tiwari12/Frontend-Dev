        <p>Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language <mark>legible, readable, and appealing</mark> when displayed. The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing (leading), and letter-spacing (tracking), and adjusting the space between pairs of letters (kerning).</p>

        <p>The term typography is also applied to the style, arrangement, and appearance of the letters, numbers, and symbols created by the process. Type design is a closely related craft, sometimes considered part of typography; most typographers do not design typefaces, and some type designers do not consider themselves typographers.</p>

        <p>In the digital age, typography has expanded to include a wide range of applications on screen. Web typography deals with the use of fonts on the World Wide Web. Historically, web browsers had limited font choices, but the advent of CSS3's `@font-face` rule has allowed for greater creative freedom, enabling designers to use any font they desire.</p>

        <p>Choosing the right typeface is <mark>absolutely crucial</mark> for setting the tone of a piece. A serif font like Times New Roman might convey tradition and formality, while a sans-serif font like Helvetica can feel modern and clean. The psychology behind these choices impacts how a reader perceives the content before they even read a single word.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, the goal of a good typographer is to honor the content. The visual form of the text should never distract from its meaning but rather enhance it. It is a subtle art, but one that has a profound impact on communication.</p>
